## Binary Search

In these variants, the lookups include a binary search.   These operations
loosely resemble microscopic cross-section lookups in Monte Carlo neutron
transport, which is our target applicaiton.  This algorithm has been abstracted
from [XSBench](https://github.com/ANL-CESAR/XSBench), which was abstracted from
[OpenMC](https://github.com/mit-crpg/openmc).
